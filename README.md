# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023

## Technical Tasks in the Project
### ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
- Do an ETL. Extract New York City data (CSV files), Transform it, and Load data Google Cloud Storage like a data lake.
### Batch Analysis
- Move data from google data storage to Google Bigquery (Data Warehouse). Transform data with DBT in Google Biguqery. Visulize data with Google Data Studio to show analyzes.
### Streaming Analytics
- Transform data in Google Cloud Storage with Spark. Firstly create a Kafka producer to have a streaming data. And then thanks to the Kafka consumer, have data and show streaming analyzes
### Orchestrate Spark Jobs
- [New york taxi data](docs/dataset.md) is a big data, it consists of a lot of csv files. We will orchestrate spark jobs with airflow to extract data.
